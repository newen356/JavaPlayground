How to build and run
- Requirements
  - JDK 17 or later.
  - Maven 3.6+ (or Gradle if you prefer, see /build-gradle branch).
  - Docker (optional for services).
- Clone
  - git clone https://github.com/newen356/JavaPlayground.git
  - cd JavaPlayground
- Build (Maven)
  - mvn clean install -DskipTests=false
  - The build produces modules and a runnable JAR in /target.
- Run a single module
  - cd algorithms
  - mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.algorithms.Runner" -Dexec.args="--problem=graph"
- Run the multi-module runnable JAR
  - After top-level mvn package, run:
    - java -jar tools/runner/target/JavaPlayground-runner-1.0.0.jar --module=projects/todo
- Docker
  - docker-compose -f scripts/docker-compose.yml up
  - This brings up product-service, auth-service, and a simple gateway.
- Run tests
  - mvn test
  - Individual module tests: cd backend/product-service && mvn test
- JMH benchmarks
  - cd benchmarks && mvn clean install
  - mvn -pl benchmarks exec:exec -Dexec.args="-bm sample -wi 3 -i 5"

IntelliJ IDEA tips
- Open the repo as a Maven project.
- Enable annotation processors if using Lombok or MapStruct (project uses Lombok in some modules).
- Run configurations
  - Create a Maven run configuration to run a module with exec plugin.
  - Create application run configs for main classes in each module.
- Debugging
  - Set breakpoints in tests and run with the debugger.
  - Use Evaluate Expression pane for quick checks.
- Code style
  - Import the style file at /docs/intellij-java-style.xml.
  - Enable ‚ÄúReformat on save‚Äù with the file watchers plugin for consistent formatting.

Testing strategy
- Unit tests
  - JUnit 5 for fast unit tests.
  - Use Mockito for behavior verification.
  - Keep unit tests small and deterministic.
- Integration tests
  - Use Spring Boot test slices for service-level integration where applicable.
  - Use Testcontainers for database-backed integration tests when available.
- End-to-end
  - Docker compose based smoke tests that validate service interactions.
- Property-based tests
  - Use jqwik or junit-quickcheck for random input tests in algorithms folder.
- Coverage
  - Use JaCoCo plugin for coverage reports.
  - Aim for meaningful coverage; prefer important logic over boilerplate.

CI / CD and automation
- Example GitHub Actions workflows in .github/workflows
  - build.yml: runs mvn -DskipTests=false on push.
  - test.yml: runs full test suite on PR.
  - release.yml: creates GitHub Release and uploads JAR artifacts on tag.
- Release artifacts
  - Releases include compiled JAR and README changelog.
  - See releases page: https://github.com/newen356/JavaPlayground/releases
- Release automation
  - Use semantic version tags: v1.2.0
  - The workflow packages the runnable JAR and pushes to GitHub Releases.

Coding style and guidelines
- Language
  - Java 17 features used selectively: records, var, enhanced switch.
- Formatting
  - 4-space indent, 120-char soft limit.
  - Line wrap at method chains for readability.
- Naming
  - Use nouns for classes, verbs for methods.
  - Prefer descriptive names over abbreviations.
- Tests
  - Method names describe behavior: shouldReturnEmptyListWhenNoItems()
- Documentation
  - Document public modules and APIs with Javadoc where useful.
  - Keep README in each module short and focused.
- Commit messages
  - Use imperative present tense: "Add binary search implementation"
  - Prefix with scope for clarity: "algorithms: add quicksort explanation"

How to contribute
- Pick an issue labeled "good first issue" or add a feature request.
- Follow the branch naming convention:
  - feature/<short-description>
  - fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>
- Create a fork, implement changes, run tests locally, and open a pull request.
- PR checklist
  - Code compiles and tests pass.
  - Add or update tests for new behavior.
  - Update docs or README as needed.
  - Link the issue in the PR description.
- Review process
  - PRs get at least one reviewer.
  - Keep PRs small and focused.
- Style and linters
  - Run mvn verify to ensure style checks pass.
  - Address all CI comments before merging.

Issue and PR workflow
- Creating issues
  - Use templates located in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE to provide a clear report.
  - Include steps to reproduce and expected behavior for bug reports.
- Pull requests
  - Use the PR template in .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.
  - Provide a short description and list of changes.
- Labels
  - help wanted, good first issue, enhancement, bug, docs.
- Backports and hotfixes
  - Use hotfix/* branches for urgent bug fixes. Tag with patch version after merge.

Example problems and solutions (samples)
- Problem: Find the longest palindromic substring
  - Approach: Expand around center or use Manacher‚Äôs algorithm.
  - Sample code (conceptual):
    - for each center expand left and right while chars match.
    - Track max length and indices.
- Problem: LRU cache
  - Approach: Doubly-linked list + hashmap for O(1) get/put.
  - Tests verify eviction order and usage update on access.
- Problem: Word ladder shortest path
  - Approach: BFS on words graph; build adjacency by wildcard mapping.
  - Use bidirectional BFS for performance on large dictionaries.
- Problem: Rate limiter (token bucket)
  - Approach: Keep last refill timestamp and current tokens. Refill on request.
  - Use synchronized block or atomic long update for thread safety.

Design notes and examples (plain language)
- Why use interfaces for services?
  - Interfaces decouple implementation and allow tests to stub behavior.
- Why choose event-driven design?
  - It improves resilience and allows independent scaling.
- When to use a cache?
  - Cache reads that are expensive and tolerate eventual consistency.
- When to prefer DB transactions vs event compensation?
  - DB transactions work for single-sink operations. For cross-service flows use sagas and compensating actions.

Common pitfalls and how this repo addresses them
- Overcomplicating small examples
  - Keep examples focused and avoid unnecessary frameworks in core exercises.
- Thread-safety bugs
  - Provide both naive and correct implementations to illustrate issues.
- Tests that depend on environment
  - Use in-memory or containerized resources for consistent tests.
